# SpatialPointProcessesGOF

This repository contains supplementary material for our power study on goodness-of-fit tests for spatial point processes.

The four files `full_evaluation_W{A}.html` contain all empirical rejection rate curves for the corresponding observation window $W_A = [0, \sqrt{A}]^2$. 
Since the files display several interactive graphics, you might need to download them before being able to see the content.
In the graphics themselves one can hide/show individual lines by clicking on the corresponding legend entries. The figures in `full_evaluation_W6.html` are the
interactive counterparts to the static figures shown in the power study paper.
